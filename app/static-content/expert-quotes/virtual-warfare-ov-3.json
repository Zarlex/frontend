        "Perhaps the most difficult problem is that of attributaion. […] Three key features of this capability to capture and utilize other computers are particularly important. First, there are no geographical limits. For example, someone in Brazil can compromise computers in South Africa to launch attacks on systems in China, which might be controlled by computers physically located in the United States. Second the owner of a captured computer often has no idea that it is being used by a remote actor for pernicious purposes.  […] And third, when some pernicious activity is perpetrakted, sophisticated analysis can typically, at best, identify the computer being used to launch the attack. It is far more difficult to determine whether that computer is being operated remotely and, if so, by whom."
